# Hr-analytics
## Objectives
Help an organisation to improve employee performance and improve employe retention(reduce attrition) by creating a HR analytics dashboard.
## Data Cleaning and Processing:
Several steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis. Null values were removed and duplicate values were eliminated. Spelling errors were identified and corrected, and appropriate data types were assigned. Additionally, a conditional column was added for attrition count, which assigned a value of 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no' based on the attrition column. Furthermore, a new measure was created to calculate the attrition rate, which was derived by dividing the total attrition count by the total employee count.
